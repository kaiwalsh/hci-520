                        As with all technology, there are times when a home network may not be 
                        working as expected. When this happens, it's important to have a toolkit of
                        possible fixes.

                        It may sound clich√©, but turning your router on and off is a great first step
                        in fixing a networking-related issue. Doing this resets the current state of 
                        the router back to normal, clearing out potential issues. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Outside of this, there are a few different things to check, including router placement, 
                        the number of devices on the network, and router settings. Network connectivity issues
                        can also be caused by service isses coming from your Internet provider.

                        When trying to diagnose and fix an issue with a home network, here is a general 
                        checklist of things you can try:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turning the router (and/or your device) off and on again</li>
                            <li>Moving to a different part of the house, to see if connectivity comes back</li>
                            <li>Turning off some Internet-connected devices, to see if performance improves</li>
                            <li>Checking for service interruptions from your Internet provider</li>
                        </ul>
