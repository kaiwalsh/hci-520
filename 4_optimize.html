                        Securing a home network can reduce the likelihood of viruses and attacks,
                        but it doesn't necessarily impact the performance of the network. If you
                        want to improve the performance of your network, there are a few things 
                        you can try.

                        The physical placement of a router in a home can have an impact on the 
                        performance of a network. The optimal placement depends on the unique 
                        layout of each home. In a home with a lot of different devices,
                        a central location is usually best.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Generally speaking, devices closer to the router will have better 
                        network performance, and devices further away will experience slower speeds 
                        and less reliable service.

                    <h3>Prioritizing Traffic</h3>
                    <section class="col col-60">
                        When people use the Internet, they are often using it for a lot of different
                        purposes: streaming, social media, and email, to name a few. These different 
                        applications take up different amounts of resources that the network has, leading
                        to overall lagginess and slowness on the network. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        By prioritizing certain types of traffic (say, email over streaming), you can 
                        tell your router how best to use the resources that it has.

                        Where is the router placed in your home? Could you get better performance by 
                        placing it somewhere else?
