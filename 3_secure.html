                        In order to decrease the likelihood of viruses and unintended usage of your
                        home network, there are a few ways that users can secure the points of entry
                        into their network.

                    <h3>Using Strong Passwords</h3>
                    <section class="col col-60">
                        A common way that attackers can get into users' systems is by cracking 
                        users' passwords. Password requirements (ex. 10 characters minimum, includes special 
                        characters, etc.) have made passwords generally more secure. However, it is crucial
                        that users are aware of measures they can take to ensure that their Wi-Fi password
                        (or any password) is as secure as possible.

                        <br/><br/>
                        According to <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32040?hl=en#zippy=" target="_blank">Google</a>, passwords should follow these
                        guidelines:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Passwords should be a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                            <li>Passwords for important platforms (ex. banking and email) should be different.</li>
                            <li>Longer passwords are generally more secure (Google recommends at least 12 characters).</li>
                            <li>Passwords should not contain personal information or common words.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Changing Default Admin Credentials</h3>
                    <section class="col col-45">
                        A large portion of home computer users do not change the default admin 
                        login of their home network. Because of this, attackers can easily 
                        gain access to home networks, simply by using default login Credentials
                        (think "username" for the username and "password" for the password.)
                        <br/><br/>
                        The following video by NETGEAR walks through the process of changing 
                        the admin credentials of a router.
